UK E-commerce Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation Using Marketing Analytics and Machine Learning Techniques

#Description
My MSc in Business Analytics dissertation focused on leveraging large datasets to enhance customer segmentation and product recommendation strategies in the UK e-commerce sector. Using advanced methodologies such as clustering, recommendation algorithms (collaborative and content-based filtering), and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, I developed actionable insights to improve user engagement. Tools including Python, RStudio, SQL, and Excel were integral to data preprocessing, analysis, and model evaluation, ensuring robust and reliable outcomes.
